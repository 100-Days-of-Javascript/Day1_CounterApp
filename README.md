A counter designed to keep track for any counting activity

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The idea of this project is quite simple. We have to create a section for storing the current count and a div for 
showing the buttons: add, substract and reset. I have used a JavaScript event listener on the buttons div, using the
specific class of each of the buttons for delegating the addition or substraction.

## Lessons Learned:

Even though this is a simple project, it was nice to (re)learn the fundamentals. Event listeners delegations as well as keyboard shortcuts will come in handy for future projects.

Also, it was very nice to find how css syntax can be used for applying styles to child nodes of a specific class
